====================
vO.6.2 Release Notes
====================

This release adds new enhancements and fixes a set of issues.

Enhancements
============

* Added schema support when updating a resource. `#153 <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-forge/pull/153>`__  (Try it using the `Storing` notebook |Binder_Storing|)

* Added a class method for creating a `Resource` from a JSON dict with the ability to discard values `#154 <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-forge/pull/154>`__  (Try it using the `Resources` notebook |Binder_Resource|)

* Updated `Reshaper._reshape` to return None instead of an empty Resource when JSON keys to keep are not found `#168 <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-forge/pull/168>`__  (Try it using the `Reshaping` notebook |Binder_Reshaping|)

* During resolving, a default resolver is now selected when no scope is provided and if only one single resolver is configured. `#168 <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-forge/pull/168>`__  (usage: Resolving notebook using |Binder_Resolving|)

* Added a new set of notebooks documentation. `#160 <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-forge/pull/160>`__, `#161 <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-forge/pull/161>`__  (Try it using the use cases notebooks |Binder_use_cases|)


Bug Fixes
=========

* Removed np.nan values when updating or creating resources using BlueBrainNexus store `#154 <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-forge/pull/154>`__  (usage: Datasets notebook using |Binder_Dataset|)

* Fixed a non consistent numeric RDF list JSON-LD serialization issue occurring when using `rdflib.Graph().serialize()`.
  When serializing a numeric RDF list (defined with @container: @list) starting with zero (e.g [0,1,3]), rdf:rest and
  rdf:first are yielded rather than a simple JSON array. This error does not occur with an RDF list not starting with
  a zero (e.g [1,2,3]). Using `pyLD <https://github.com/digitalbazaar/pyld>`__ solves the issue `#159 <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-forge/pull/159>`__ (usage: RDF IO notebook using |Binder_RDF|)

* Fixed downloading multiple files from multiple resources. `#152 <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-forge/pull/152>`__,
  `#155 <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-forge/pull/155>`__  (usage: Datasets notebook using |Binder_Dataset|)

* Fixed the used version of `nest-asyncio` in setup.py to avoid `This event loop is already running` error caused by older version of `nest-asyncio`
  being introduced by dependencies `#163 <https://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus-forge/pull/163>`__
